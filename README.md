## Summary
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive subtype lacking targeted therapies. This project explores how GABA receptor signaling, particularly the GABRA3 subunit, may influence proliferation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in TNBC.

**Data:**  
RNA-seq data from 213 samples (97 TNBC tumors and 116 normal breast tissues) were analyzed. These samples were extracted from the TCGA-BRCA project and filtered based on ESR1, PGR, and ERBB2 expression thresholds to isolate TNBC cases.

The analysis involved differential gene expression, pathway enrichment, and subgroup stratification to identify key GABA subunits and their associated gene expression patterns.
